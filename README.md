**What's the Pattern** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Emily Lee**

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/stone-rocky-earth?path=README.md%3A4%3A0)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[W3Schools, freeCodeCamp, musicMasterWorks, CSSreference.io]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I have never learned javascript before and although I have had some experience with HTML and CSS prior to this, this was the first time I had to utilize all 3 languages together to create a program/webpage.
It was definitely difficult getting use to the syntax of Javascript because I have never seen it before but I am very glad that my background Python knowledge helped me understand its foundations and logically 
piece together what I was trying to do. For example, when coding the "Handling guesses - game logic" portion of the assignment, I was able to write a pseudo-code of the entire process in Python but in order to translate
it into Javascript, I continuously referred back to previous code that the assignment had provided and accessed third party websites for additional help in how to properly write the syntax. Despite the initial difficulties
in getting used to new languages, I thought this was an amazing, hands-on, and practical experience in understanding and executing how to pull together 3 languages to create a working game. Especially with much of the 
skeleton already given, this was very beginner's friendly, which I highly appreciated, and was a great learning experience.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[How do you create responsive web pages that are easily accessible and usable by users on all devices and by users of all ages? This spans an extensive
range of features such as scaling, resolution, or scrolling, but I am also curious about how we would develop a game, for example, that is able to be 
played by people with color blindness. There are so many factors to consider because it is impossible to predict every user that will be accessing the webpage but
as a developer, how do we best address this issue and what are the technical skills to carrying them out?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would take the time to create a database that tracks how many times the user has won. 
The more times the user has won, the more difficult the game will start off on to imitate what it is like to continue leveling up. This would require
the program to remember who is playing, how many times he has played, and his track record of wins and losses. If a player loses, then the difficulty
would be scaled down by one level.]
